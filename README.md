# Mission-to-Mars
In this module, you'll automate a web browser to visit different websites to extract data about the Mission to Mars. You'll store it in a NoSQL database, and then render the data in a web application created with Flask. The completed work will be displayed in your portfolio, which you will also create.  Web scraping is a method used by organizations worldwide to extract online data for analysis. Large companies employ web scraping to assess their reputations or track their competitors' online presence.  On a smaller scale, web scraping automates tedious tasks for personal projects. For example, if you're collecting current news on a specific subject, web scraping can make it a simple process. Instead of visiting each website and copying an article, a web scraping script will perform those actions and save the scraped data for later analysis.
